## 🎯 Key Machine Learning Terms (Beginner-Friendly)

| Term | Simple Explanation | Example |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| **Algorithm** | A set of rules for the computer to learn patterns | Decision Tree, Neural Network |
| **Feature** | An input variable used to make predictions | Height, weight, age |
| **Label/Target** | The thing you want to predict | Price, category, yes/no |
| **Training** | Teaching the algorithm using example data | Showing 1000 photos of cats and dogs |
| **Prediction** | What the trained model thinks about new data | "This photo shows a cat" |
| **Accuracy** | How often the model gets the right answer | 85% accuracy = right 85 times out of 100 |
| **Overfitting** | When model memorizes training data too well | Student who memorizes answers but can't solve new problems |
| **Validation** | Testing the model on data it hasn't seen | Pop quiz to see if student really learned |

## 📝 Final Notes

This course emphasizes **understanding over memorization**. Don't just run the code - experiment with it! Change parameters, try different datasets, break things and fix them. That's how real learning happens.

**Happy Learning!** 🎉
